# Admin Features Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` is configured in GitHub secrets
- [ ] All new files are committed to your repository
- [ ] Database server is accessible from deployment environment

### **2. Files Added/Modified**
```
âœ… New Files:
- models/ActivityLog.js (Activity logging model)
- routes/admin.js (Admin API endpoints)
- config/associations.js (Database associations)
- scripts/setup-activity-log.js (Setup script)
- ADMIN_FEATURES.md (Feature documentation)

âœ… Modified Files:
- server.js (Added admin routes and associations)
- routes/users.js (Added user creation endpoint)
- routes/auth.js (Added activity logging)
- routes/files.js (Added file download logging)
- client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.js (Enhanced UI)
- client/src/contexts/AuthContext.js (Enhanced logout)
```

### **3. Database Setup (After Deployment)**

#### **Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
The server will automatically create the ActivityLog table when it starts up, thanks to the associations being loaded.

#### **Option B: Manual Setup**
If you prefer manual control, run this after deployment:
```bash
node scripts/setup-activity-log.js
```

### **4. Verification Steps**

#### **Check Database Connection**
```bash
node scripts/test-database-connection.js
```

#### **Verify Admin Panel**
1. Deploy your application
2. Log in as an admin user
3. Navigate to Admin Panel
4. Check for new tabs: "User Management" and "Activity Log"
5. Test adding a new user
6. Test viewing activity logs

### **5. Environment Variables Required**

```env
# Required for admin features
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@hostname:3306/database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **6. API Endpoints to Test**

```bash
# Test user creation (admin only)
POST /api/users
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User",
  "role": "user",
  "isActive": true
}

# Test activity log (admin only)
GET /api/admin/activity-log

# Test activity stats (admin only)
GET /api/admin/activity-stats
```

### **7. Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: "DATABASE_URL is not defined"
- **Solution**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in GitHub secrets
- **Check**: Verify the secret name matches exactly

**Issue**: "ActivityLog table not found"
- **Solution**: Run the setup script after deployment
- **Command**: `node scripts/setup-activity-log.js`

**Issue**: "Admin routes not working"
- **Solution**: Check if admin routes are loaded in server.js
- **Check**: Verify `require('./routes/admin')` is present

**Issue**: "Activity logging not working"
- **Solution**: Check database associations
- **Check**: Verify `require('./config/associations')` is loaded

### **8. Post-Deployment Testing**

#### **Admin User Test**
1. Create a new admin user
2. Log in with the new admin account
3. Access admin panel
4. Verify all tabs are visible

#### **Activity Logging Test**
1. Log in as any user
2. Download a file
3. Log out
4. Check admin panel activity log
5. Verify activities are recorded

#### **User Management Test**
1. Add a new user through admin panel
2. Verify user appears in user list
3. Test user activation/deactivation
4. Test user deletion (non-admin users)

### **9. Monitoring & Maintenance**

#### **Database Growth**
- ActivityLog table will grow over time
- Consider implementing log rotation for production
- Monitor table size and performance

#### **Security Considerations**
- All admin endpoints require admin authentication
- Activity logs include IP addresses for security
- Regular review of admin access logs

### **10. Rollback Plan**

If issues arise, you can temporarily disable admin features by:

1. Comment out admin routes in `server.js`
2. Remove admin tab from `AdminPanel.js`
3. Restart the application

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Admin panel loads without errors
- [ ] New user creation works
- [ ] Activity logging captures login/logout
- [ ] Activity logging captures file downloads
- [ ] Activity log tab displays data correctly
- [ ] All admin API endpoints respond properly

## ðŸ“ž **Support**

If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check server logs for error messages
4. Test database connectivity separately

**Note**: The new admin features are designed to work seamlessly with your existing deployment setup. The ActivityLog table will be created automatically when the server starts, and all new functionality is protected by admin authentication.
