## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of InfinityFire seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@infinityfire.com](mailto:security@infinityfire.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
* **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
* **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
* **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
* **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
* **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer to receive vulnerability reports in English, but we can also handle reports in other languages if needed.

## Policy

InfinityFire follows the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

## What to expect

* **48 hours** - Initial response to your report
